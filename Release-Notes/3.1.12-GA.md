# Broadleaf 3.1.12-GA

_Released on January 27, 2015_

This is the 12th release in the 3.1 line of Broadleaf and we recommend updating to this release immediately. Some of the notable changes in this release:

### Pricing modifications

Previously in Broadleaf whenever you priced an order (like with `orderService.save(order, true)` then individual item prices were updated. This meant that if a customer added an item that cost $5 to their cart, the admin updated the price to be $10, and then the triggered an order reprice (like if they added another item to their cart) then that item would get updated to $10.

This is a little confusing and is not what we want. The fixed functionality does the following:

1. Once an item is added to the cart by a customer that item price is never refreshed
2. When a user logs in and pulls a "stale" cart back after login, item prices are refreshed

If you want to explicitly refresh the item prices in an Order/Cart, we have added a new method to `OrderService` for this functionality: `orderService.save(order, true, true)`. The second boolean is to update item prices.

### Solr indexing Changes

We added some locking around triggering an index to make sure that 2 threads cannot trigger a reindex at the same time and fixed an edge case bug where indexing might duplicate results (we made sure to clear out the index before rebuilding it)..
